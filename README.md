# iSeeD2IP

iSeeD2IP is an simple and easy to use OSX utility to detect the IP of any Diablo II game. As a professional Diablo Clone hunter this software will be of great help. It’s true that a quick command in terminal will provide the same information, but there’s nothing wrong with a simple application.
